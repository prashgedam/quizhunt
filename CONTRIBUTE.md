## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to add more multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to the existing quizzes:

1. Fork the Repository:
   - Go to the QuizHunt repository on GitHub.
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository page to create a forked copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. Clone the Forked Repository:
   - After forking, navigate to your GitHub account and open the forked QuizHunt repository.

     ```
3. Add New MCQ Questions:
   - Open the JavaScript file corresponding to the quiz you want to add questions to. For example, if you want to add questions to the C++ quiz, open the "cppquiz.js" file.
   - The JavaScript file should contain an array of objects, with each object representing a question and its options. The format might look something like this:

     ```javascript
       {  
          question: "Who invented C++?",
          a: "Dennis Ritchie",
          b: "Ken Thompson",
          c: "Brian Kernighan",
          d: "Bjarne Stroustrup",
          correct: "d",
       },
     ```
4. Save the Changes:
5. Commit and Push Changes:
   - After adding the new question and creating the contribute readme file, save the changes in the repository.
   - Use the following commands to commit and push the changes to your forked repository:

     ```

     git commit -m "Add new MCQ questions to the C++ quiz"
